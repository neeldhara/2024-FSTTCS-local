> [!globe]- For International Participants
>
> If you are applying for a conference visa, and you need supporting documents from conference organizers, please fill out [this form]().
> 
> You should not have any trouble in terms of language barriers in the cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. Most people understand and speak English, and most signage is typically in English as well. 
>
> The currency in India is the Indian Rupee (INR). You can exchange your currency at the airport or at any of the local banks. The campus has a bank and an ATM as well. While you will find that QR-code based payment systems, powered by UPI, are increasingly the default at most places, credit and debit cards are still widely accepted, including on campus. Please make sure to enable your cards for international transactions. We recommend carrying some cash for exceptions.
>
> Most places on campus will have WiFi connectivity. We have eduroam, and we will also share the credentials for the local network with you over email and on a Whatsapp group a couple of days ahead of the conference. That said, having some cellular connectivity will be useful for things like booking cabs or using Google maps when outside WiFi range. 
>
> The voltage in India is 230V, 50Hz. The standard socket type is the C type, which is the same as the European plug. If you are coming from a country that uses a different type of plug, you would want to keep a travel adapter handy.
>
> Food in the state of Gujarat is predominantly vegetarian and can be spicy. We will ensure that there are milder options available at the conference lunches, but if you have specific dietary restrictions, please do indicate it at the time of registration.
>
> If you have any questions, please let us know! 

> [!TLDR]- For Speakers
>
> The conference will be held in a hybrid format and talks will be recorded. A consent form will be shared with you over email, which you could use to opt out of the recording if you desire.
>
> All rooms will have a computer that is already connected to the AV system in the room. It would be simplest to prepare your presentation in a standard format (PDF/HTML/PPT) so that we can load it directly from the in-house system.
>
> If you have a good reason to use your own laptop for the presentation (e.g, fonts available only locally or a Keynote presentation that does not convert well to PPT or PDF), then please carry appropriate connectors if your laptop does not have a HDMI port. It is recommended that you test your setup at least one break in advance of the session that your talk is in. Please ping the session chair or any of the volunteers for help with this.
