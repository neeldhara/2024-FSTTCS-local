### Online Participation

FSTTCS is a hybrid event and the talks will be streamed over Youtube. 

We are also excited to launch the [FSTTCS Circle Community](https://fsttcs.circle.so/join?invitation_token=ce1adca3a34dec8f43b0aff9979d14cdbf2a87fe-57e8f55d-c416-40c5-90d0-7e2b46ee5de2), where both online and in-person participants can hang out to discuss, and so the virtual participants don't miss out on the hallway track! If you love the social aspect of attending a conference, we hope you'll enjoy hanging out on Circle, and if you don't love the social aspect, we got you covered too:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Enough people are endorsing this that at our next conference, those of us who dislike the hallway track can cordon off a hallway just for ourselves to stand around and complain about how bad it is. Looks like we&#39;ll get a good crowd. <a href="https://t.co/tbYk3Sec3n">https://t.co/tbYk3Sec3n</a></p>&mdash; Shriram Krishnamurthi 🟤 🏴‍☠️ 👨🏽‍🏫 🚴‍♂️ 🏏 (@ShriramKMurthi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi/status/1481658852705714178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To the extent possible, some of our social events may be open to online participants too. In any case, we'll nudge our IRL participants to share receipts (photos and videos), so our virtual friends can follow along :)

Please sign up below to keep up with updates over email and join us on [Circle](https://fsttcs.circle.so/join?invitation_token=ce1adca3a34dec8f43b0aff9979d14cdbf2a87fe-57e8f55d-c416-40c5-90d0-7e2b46ee5de2) for the full experience!
