## Squash at IIT Gandhinagar

Looking for a great way to unwind after the first day of talks at FSTTCS?

Jaison Manjaly led the IITGN team to a Gold medal at the inter-IIT sports meet in 2023, and is happy to share his squash practice session on the evening of the 16th with guests who are game. 

Sign up below so we can gauge interest and may be turn this into a mini-tournament :)
