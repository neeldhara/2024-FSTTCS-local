## Birdwatching

IIT Gandhinagar is home to a variety of birds, and if there is enough interest, we will be happy to organize a birdwatching session. You will be guided through some campus trails, and pick up a lot of fascinating trivia. 

Dr. Janki Teli, a birdwatching expert, will be there to guide us. Please carry drinking water and dress for cold weather. Wear comfortable walking shoes. We will be meeting at [this location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3YMwwiPBkD9TD9XW7) (in front of Central Arcade) at 7am.

For the activity, it will be nice, but not necessary, to have the following items with you.

 - A binocular suitable for observing birds.
- Download the [Merlin Bird ID app](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/). After installing the app, download the "India: North" pack from within the app to identify birds commonly found on our campus.
