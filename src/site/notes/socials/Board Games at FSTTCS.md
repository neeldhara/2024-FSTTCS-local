We are delighted to invite you to board game evenings at FSTTCS!

These events are informal hangouts where we get to come together and play some games. We have an array of options available in-house, with a lot of variety in terms of play time and complexity. You are also very welcome to bring your own games that you'd like to share. 

Please fill out the form below by the 10th of December to indicate your interest to help us plan appropriately. This is a FREE event, and is organized by [Jyothi Krishnan](https://ccl.iitgn.ac.in/team/jyothi-krishnan) (CCL, IITGN), [Saraswati Nanoti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saraswati-nanoti-37898a100/?originalSubdomain=in) (CSE, IITGN), and [Umang Bhaskar](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~umang/) (STCS, TIFR, Mumbai).

1. CCL, Academic Block 3 (good luck finding it ✌️)
2. Faculty Lounge, Academic Block 7
3. FSTTCS Participant Lounge, Academic Block 13/401G (at least as hard to find as CCL)
