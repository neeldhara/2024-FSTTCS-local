## GIFT City Run

The Shilp Aarambh GIFT City Run was conceived as a celebration of fitness, community, and a shared vision for a healthier, drug-free future. The event is in its third edition and will be held on the 15th of December. You have the option to choose between a 5KM run, a 10KM run, and a half-marathon.

The registration ends on Sunday, 8th December, 2024, 11.59 PM IST or as soon as running places are filled, whichever is earlier.

The [event website](https://shilpaarambh.com/) has all the information you need. If you do sign up, please let us know by also filling up the form below. Saraswati, one of the FSTTCS volunteers, is already training for the half marathon, and is happy to have some company!
