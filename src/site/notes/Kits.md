| Amazons         | This is a 2 player partizan game. Place your 4 pieces (Amazons) on the indicated spaces. An Amazon moves like a chess queen and then shoots a flaming arrow (as far as she likes, in any direction) onto an empty square. Cross off the square where the arrow lands. It is no longer reachable. Whoever makes the last move wins the game. | by Walter Zamkauskas |

| Dodgem   | This is a 2 player partizan game. Each player picks a colour and places 3 pieces of that colour along an edge (on the indicated spaces). On a turn, select a piece and move it one step. Pieces can move forward and sideways (relative to their starting edge) onto empty spaces. They cannot reverse. The first player to move all their pieces off their opposite edge wins the game.                                                                                                                                     | by Colin Vout     |
| Star Nim | This is an impartial 2 player game. Colour of pieces does not matter here. Place a piece at each of the numbered locations. On a turn a player may remove either a single piece or two pieces that are directly connected by an edge. Players take turns removing pieces from the board. The player who removes the last piece wins the game.                                                                                                                                                                                | by Martin Gardner |
| TacTix   | This is an impartial 2 player game. Colour of pieces does not matter here. Place a piece in each square. On a turn select a row or a column and remove any number of adjacent pieces. If there is a gap between 2 pieces they cannot be removed on a single turn. The player who removes the last piece wins the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                   |
| Mill     | This is a 2 player partizan game. Each player takes 9 pieces of a colour. Players alternate turns placing a piece to the board. If they get 3 in a row, they form a mill. After forming a mill remove an oponent's piece from the game. Pieces in a mill are safe from removal. Once all a players pieces are placed on a turn they can move one piece a step along an edge. Play continues until a player has only 3 pieces left. At this stage they can move pieces to any location on the board. They then lose the game. | Traditional       |
