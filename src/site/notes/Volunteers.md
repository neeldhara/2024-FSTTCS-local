#### Next Steps for Volunteers

If you applied to the program and you have not been shortlisted below, it is only because we were constrained by the number of slots that we could offer, and all applications were of very high quality. We hope that you are able to make alternate arrangements for covering your registration expenses and are able to join us as FSTTCS anyway, and we look forward to meeting you at the conference.

If you applied to the program and have been shortlisted: congratulations! You will hear from us over email soon. Please make note of the following important next steps:

1. Please join the volunteer Whatsapp group, an invitation link will be communicated over email.
2. ~~Please register using the volunteer registration form.~~  
   _Update: volunteer registrations are now closed. Thanks for joining in!_
   
   If you have registered already, the form will allow you to indicate your participant ID, so that we can process a refund in due course. It is crucial that you complete your registration by the end of the day, **24th of November, AoE**.
