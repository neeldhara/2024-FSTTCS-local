### The FSTTCS Volunteer Program

We are delighted to announce a volunteer program for FSTTCS 2024. We invite prospective student and postdoc participants to apply for our volunteer program. 

**Who should apply.** We encourage you to apply if (a) you are interested in helping with the organization of FSTTCS and (b) you are looking for financial support to attend the conference. In particular, students (undergraduates, masters students, PhD students) and post-doctoral fellows are eligible to apply.  

_If you do not meet these criteria but would like to volunteer nonetheless, we welcome pro bono offers of help! Please reach out by sending an email to fsttcs2024@gmail.com._

**What the program offers.** Chosen volunteers will not have to pay a registration fee for the conference and the allied workshops that they choose to attend. The program does not cover travel or accommodation.

**Logistics.** If selected as a volunteer, you will be asked to fill out a separate registration form. In case you have already registered and are selected as a volunteer, you will be eligible for a refund. Please note that we have limited spots, and that applying does **not** guarantee selection in the program. Please 

Important Dates:

1. **Deadline to apply: 20th November, 2024.**
2. Shortlist announcement: 22nd November, 2024
3. Registration deadline for volunteers: 24th November, 2024
