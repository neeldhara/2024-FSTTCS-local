### The FSTTCS Volunteer Program



We are delighted to announce a volunteer program for FSTTCS 2024. We invite prospective student and postdoc participants to apply for our volunteer program. We encourage you to apply if (a) you are interested in helping with the organization of FSTTCS and (b) you are looking for financial support to attend the conference. 

Please note that we have limited spots, and that applying does **not** guarantee selection in the program. Chosen volunteers will be awarded a flat honorarium amounting to Rs. 10,000. Please note that even if you are selected as a volunteer, you are expected to register for the conference as usual. The payouts of the honorarium amount will be made _after_ the conference is over.

**Deadline to apply: 20th November, 2024.**

_Eligibility. Students (undergraduates, masters students, PhD students) and post-doctoral fellows are eligible to apply._ _If you do not meet these criteria but would like to volunteer nonetheless, we welcome pro bono offers of help, please reach out by sending an email to fsttcs2024@gmail.com._
