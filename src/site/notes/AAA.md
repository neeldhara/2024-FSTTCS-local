### AAA

We are thrilled to introduce the *attentive attendee award* at FSTTCS 2024!

Before opening the floor for questions from the audience, the session chairs of contributed talks will ask a questionÂ _to the audience_. The first person to answer the question (correctly) gets a brownie point.

The attendee with most brownie points across Track A talks and the attendee with most brownie points across Track B/RHPL talks get a brownie each, and bragging rights.

Ties will be unbroken assuming contenders have at least 5 brownie points each, i.e, everyone tied for the top spot gets a (separate) brownie and bragging rights.

PS. Credit to [Rohit](https://rohitvaish.in/) for the theory, blame the organizers for the practice :)
