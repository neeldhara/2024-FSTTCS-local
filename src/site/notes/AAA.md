### AAA

We are thrilled to introduce the *attentive attendee award* at FSTTCS 2024!

At FSTTCS, the session chairs of the contributed talks will ask a question before opening the floor for questions. The first person to answer the question gets a brownie point.

The attendee with most brownie points across Track A talks and the attendee with most brownie points across Track B/RHPL talks get a brownie each, and bragging rights. 

Ties will be unbroken assuming contenders have at least 5 brownie points each, i.e, everyone gets a brownie and bragging rights.
