### For International Participants

> [!TLDR] To apply for an invitation letter, and a letter of clearance from the Ministry of External Affairs, please fill out [[Visa\|this form]] no later than 9th October, midnight, AoE.


##### Do I need a visa?

All foreign nationals entering India are required to possess a valid international travel document in the form of a national passport with a valid visa from an Indian Mission/Post or eVisa (Limited Categories) from Bureau of Immigration, Ministry of Home Affairs.

We recommend all participants that require a visa to travel to India, to apply for a **Conference visa**. If an individual who is not attending the conference plans to accompany you, they will likely need an Indian **Tourist visa**.
