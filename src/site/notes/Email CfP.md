FSTTCS 2024 is the 44th conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science. It is organised by IARCS, the Indian Association for Research in Computing Science, in association with ACM India. It is a forum for presenting original results in foundational aspects of Computer Science and Software Technology. Within Track B, there is a focus on soliciting submissions in the areas of Programming Languages and Practical Verification, in addition to theoretical results.

FSTTCS 2024 will be held in IIT Gandhinagar during December 16–18, 2024. The conference is being organized as an in-person event.

We also have several exciting workshops lined up! You can register for the conference and any subset of the workshops, or just for one or more of the workshops. 

We are also on a social media network near you. Please follow us to keep up with updates:
